// LECTURE: let, const and var
// 1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some
// countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)
// 2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never
// change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
// 3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens
// LECTURE: Basic Operators
// 1. If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population,
// then how many people would live in each half?
// 2. Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console
// 3. Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than
// Finland?
// 4. The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does your country
// have less people than the average country?
// 5. Based on the variables you created, create a new variable 'description'
// which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million
// people speak portuguese
